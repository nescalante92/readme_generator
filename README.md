## Description 
When working on an open-source project on Github, it's important to have a high-quality README for any given application. This includes the app's purpose, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make any contributions. This helps to orient developers on your app's complete functionality.

## User Story
As a developer I want a README generator to quickly create a professional README for a new project by simply answering a few questions. 

-------------

## Acceptance Criteria 
-   When prompted for information about the application repository, then a high-quality, professional README is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description/Table of Contents/Installation/Usage/License/Contribution/Tests/Questions.

-   When I enter my project title, then it is displayed as the title of the README.

-   When I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.

-   When I choose a license for my application from a list of options, then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.

-   When I enter my GitHub username, then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions/Contact, with a link to my GitHub profile.

-   When I enter my email address, then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions/Contact, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions.

-   When I click on the links in the Table of Contents, then I am taken to the corresponding section of the README.
